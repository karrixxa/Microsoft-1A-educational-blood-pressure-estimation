## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project explores whether blood pressure can be estimated from **photoplethysmography (PPG)**, an optical pulse signal that can be captured by wearable devices. PPG serves as the model input, while the corresponding arterial blood-pressure (ABP) waveform provides systolic and diastolic pressure targets. Before building models, we focused on understanding the recordings and assessing their quality.

### Connection to Break Through Tech AI
This work is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Studio** program, in which student teams tackle real-world machine learning problems with an industry host company.

### Host Company: Microsoft
Microsoft builds AI-powered platforms and tools to meet evolving customer needs and is committed to expanding access to AI responsibly.

### Why It Matters
High blood pressure (hypertension) raises the risk of heart attack, heart disease, and stroke [CDC]. It affects roughly 1.3 billion people worldwide, and many are unaware they have it because it often causes few or no symptoms [1]. Standard cuff-based measurement is reliable but uncomfortable and impractical for continuous monitoring. Cuffless approaches based on signals like PPG could make frequent, convenient blood-pressure tracking possible — supporting earlier detection and treatment.

## 📊 Data Exploration

We used the **UCI Cuff-Less Blood Pressure Estimation dataset**, stored in four MATLAB (`.mat`) files containing PPG, ABP, and ECG signals. Our exploration so far focuses on **Part 1 (3,000 recordings)**, with plans to expand to the remaining parts.

- **Sampling rate:** 125 Hz → each 5-second window = 625 samples
- **Data type:** continuous physiological waveforms
- **Checks performed:** recording lengths, signal distributions, missing values, zero values, example waveforms
- **NeuroKit2 analysis:** filtering, pulse detection, signal-quality metrics
- **Features computed:** pulse rate, amplitude, approximate pulse width, and other waveform statistics, compared against draft blood-pressure targets
